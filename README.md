# Covid-Data-Analysis

COVID-19, a flu that started with affecting a few countries was then spread worldwide and was 
declared a pandemic by WHO (World Heath Organization) on March 2020 and since has been 
identified as a threat to the entire world population. Various studies were being conducted by 
researchers and scientists of all countries to find a cure for the pandemic. This work represents a 
dataset which is focused on COVID-19 at a global level and also provides analysis and spread of 
the disease. <br />
Multiple factors play a role for the infection to spread, therefore, extensive research was 
being carried to better fight the disease. The dataset used in this project was provided by Johns 
Hopkins University Center of System Science and Engineering. They aggregate the data from 
WHO, national and regional public health and have made it available on a public GitHub.<br />

## This project only took into account the data that was available during December 2020 and does not include any findings that were discovered later.
